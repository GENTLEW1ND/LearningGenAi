Husain, and contemporary Indian artists. | Ideal for a relaxed afternoon; café on site serves light refreshments. |\\n| | **Swaminarayan Akshardham** | A sprawling cultural complex with intricate stone carvings, a 3‑D water show, and a beautiful night laser show. | No photography inside; plan at least 3\\u202fhrs. |\\n| | **Gandhi Smriti** | The former Birla House where Mahatma Gandhi spent his last 144 days; exhibits his life and the freedom movement. | Free entry; modest crowds—great for a reflective stop. |\\n| **Nature & Gardens** | **Lodhi Gardens** | A lush, historic garden dotted with 15th‑century tombs; perfect for picnics, jogging, or a quiet sunrise walk. | Early morning is magical, especially during the migratory bird season (Oct‑Mar). |\\n| | **Garden of Five Senses** | A landscaped park with themed sections (herb garden, water features, sculpture trails) that engages all the senses. | Ideal for families; there’s a café and occasional cultural performances. |\\n| | **Delhi Ridge (Mukherjee Nagar, Deer Park)** | The “green lung” of the city—wooded trails, deer sightings, and historic monuments. | Rent a bike for a longer ride; best early morning or late afternoon. |\\n| **Markets & Shopping** | **Chandni Chowk** | A bustling labyrinth of lanes selling street food, saris, jewelry, and spices. | Take a guided rickshaw tour to navigate efficiently; try the iconic jalebi stall at Old Famous Jalebi Wale. |\\n| | **Dilli Haat** | An open‑air craft bazaar showcasing artisans from across India; great for hand‑woven textiles, handicrafts, and diverse regional food stalls. | Fridays–Sundays are busiest; check the performance schedule on the portal. |\\n| | **Khan Market** | Upscale shopping with books, designer boutiques, and gourmet food stores. | Perfect for a leisurely coffee break—try “Khan Chacha” for kebabs. |\\n| **Food & Culinary** | **Paranthe Wali Gali (Old Delhi)** | Famous for stuffed parathas (potato, paneer, banana) served with curd and pickles. | Go early (before lunch rush) for the freshest batch. |\\n| | **Karim’s (Jama Masjid area)** | Legendary Mughal cuisine—mutton korma, kebabs, and nihari. | Expect a wait; the authenticity is worth it. |\\n| | **Biryani at Al Jawahar** | Classic Hyderabadi biryani in the heart of Old Delhi. | Take a taxi; traffic can be heavy during dinner. |\\n| | **Street Food at Connaught Place** | From momos to chaats; the “Circular” area has many eateries offering both Indian and international flavors. | Nighttime is lively; try the “Chaat Bazaar” stall for tangy treats. |\\n| **Off‑the‑Beaten‑Path** | **Mehrauli Archaeological Park** | A sprawling ruin-filled park behind Qutub Minar with hidden step‑wells, ancient tombs, and peaceful walking paths. | Bring water; paths can be uneven. |\\n| | **Hauz Khas Village** | A blend of medieval ruins, trendy cafés, boutiques, and an art‑gallery scene. Perfect for sunset by the lake. | Evening is best; the lake backdrop is Instagram‑friendly. |\\n| | **Sanjay Van** | A dense forest area near Qutub Minar, great for bird‑watching and quiet nature walks. | Ideal for early‑morning treks; carry a flashlight for later walks. |\\n| | **Agrasen ki Baoli** | A step‑well hidden in the middle of a bustling area; eerie, historic, and photogenic. | Visit during daylight; the well is narrow, so watch your step. |\\n\\n### Quick “Itinerary” Sample (3‑Day Stay)\\n\\n| Day | Morning | Afternoon | Evening |\\n|-----|---------|-----------|---------|\\n| **1** | Visit **India Gate**, **Rashtrapati Bhavan** (exterior), and **Parliament House** (photo ops) | Explore **Red Fort** + **Jama Masjid** (walk through Chandni Chowk for lunch) | Sunset at **Lodhi Gardens** + dinner at **Khan Market** |\\n| **2** | **Hum Humayun’s Tomb** & **Qutub Minar** (combine with **Mehrauli Archaeological Park**) | Lunch at **Khan Chacha** or **Karim’s** | Light‑and‑sound show at **Akshardham** |\\n| **3** | **National Museum** or **NGMA** | Shop and snack at **Dilli Haat** | Evening stroll & drinks at **Hauz Khas Village** (lakeside view) |\\n\\n### Practical Tips for Visiting New\\u202fDelhi\\n\\n1. **Transportation** – The Delhi Metro is fast, clean, and covers most major attractions (e.g., Red Fort, Qutub Minar, Akshardham). For short distances, auto‑rickshaws or app‑based cabs (Ola, Uber) are convenient.\\n2. **Weather** – Winters (Nov‑Feb) are the most pleasant (10‑20\\u202f°C). Summer can soar above 40\\u202f°C, so carry water, sunglasses, and a hat. Monsoon (July‑Sept) brings occasional heavy rain—carry a small umbrella.\\n3. **Dress Code** – Light cottons are ideal. When visiting religious sites (mosques, temples), cover shoulders and knees. Shoes are usually removed at the entrance.\\n4. **Safety** – Delhi is generally safe for tourists, but stay vigilant in crowded markets, keep belongings close, and use reputable transport services at night.\\n5. **Connectivity** – Pick up a local SIM (e.g., Jio, Airtel) at the airport or any mobile shop; data plans are cheap and fast.\\n6. **Cultural Etiquette** – Tipping 5‑10\\u202f% in restaurants is customary. When bargaining in markets, smile and negotiate respectfully.\\n\\nEnjoy your trip to New\\u202fDelhi! The city’s layers of history, flavors, and energy will leave you with unforgettable memories. If you need more details—like specific restaurant recommendations, day‑trip options to nearby places (e.g., Agra, Jaipur), or help planning a customized itinerary—just let me know!'"
